**Hackathon pitch by Rebecca Rosen**

Identifying and visualizing older adult-friendly NYC neighborhoods


Challenge

Create at least two neighborhood or block-level quality of life measures that are specific to the older adult population in NYC
Visualize, or propose an approach to visualize, these measures in an interface designed for older adults internet users

The challenge team should be creative when developing quality of life measures.  Think beyond simple neighborhood characteristics and socioeconomic measures. Consider access to health care, recreational areas, culture, and infrastructure.

Background

NYC government, nongovernmental organizations, and academic researchers have done extensive work to create data-driven city neighborhood profiles.  Studies describe health indicators and various quality of life indicators such as walkability, access to jobs, and blight.  These studies leverage various combinations of survey, census, and administrative data. 

According to the Profile of Older New Yorkers published by the NYC Department for the Aging, there were nearly 1.5 million adults over the age of 60 measured in the 2010 Census.  This number represents a 12.4% increase since the 2000 Census and the number will continue to grow as the baby-boomer generation ages.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no NYC neighborhood profiles that are targeted towards older adults and the features that most affect their quality of life.
