## Pitches:

**1. WHO DROWNS FIRST (Justin Salmon)**
Using NYC elevation data assess which areas of the city will be under water if the sea level rises.

*Data*: on NYC.gov opendata

**Deliverable**: An interactive map of NYC identifying underwater neighbourhoods as a function of sea level (or a set of maps).

**2. WHO IS MORE GENEROUS IN TIPPING? (Justin Salmon)**
Using NYC taxis dataset map tipping rate to origin-destinations & origin-destination socioeconomic descriptors.

*Data*: NYC.gov

**3. SONIFICATION OF NYC URBAN DATA (Justin Salmon)**
Sonify an urban dataset, for example crime by area.

*Data*: any NYC urban dataset 

**Deliverable**: A sound map of NYC or a 2D interactive map where hovering over an area sonifies its data with sound

**4. HEAT LEAKING IN NIR UO DATA  (Mohit Sharma)**
Identify heat leaking windows in CUSP UP NIR data. Identify the reason of leak (e.g. AC) and measure heat leak in time

*Data*: UO NIR images (provided by Mohit)

**Deliverable**: A heat-leaking time series for every leaking window in the data

**5. WHO DONATED IN THE 2016 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN (Sunny)**
